## Objectives

- familiarise yourself with CM shared folder structure (DONE)
- arrange with Jonathan today for induction (7 pm induction, CM already paid fee) 
- read through annual report MDPI to understand how we can pitch our tools to publishers (DONE)
- read through ScienceSource communication plan to understand what the targets for community building are (DONE)
- read through the template of focus group to form an idea of how we should structure ours

## 1) Fellowship programme
### MDPI
- MDPI report heavily stresses the number of papers published as a metric for growth --> each paper brings revenue through Article Processing Charges (APCs)
- despite their stress on the transition to OA, they also stress the impact factor of their papers
- self-declared driving principles:
	- accessibility (=OA)
	- speed (=latest research readily available)
	- service (=scholar community support via tools)
	- flexibility (=development of new tools and adaptation)
	- simplicity (=tools found in one place)
	- sustainability (=partnerships and awards to support preservation of papers in the long term)

#### Conclusions:
- We can leverage the most on these principles:
	- accessibility
	- speed
	- SERVICE
	- flexibility

- publisher makes the knowledge accessible and CM makes it usable to produce new insights --> this is done by empowering the researcher via use of new tools that are appropriate for the 'new wave' of scientific literature (old approaches of subscription and reading papers one by one are no longer fit for purpose)

### PLOS
- Interesting financial analysis on PLOS loss of profit in 2016 here: https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/11/27/plos-reports-2016-financial-loss/
- Scientific Reports has surpassed it as the main OA megajournal... looks like Nature's brand name is winning over the same market. Journal prestige is still the most important driver for researchers and grant success rate
- However there are reports of academics who think that Scientific Reports is a red flag of poor science and paying to get 'nature' on your paper

## 2) MKSP induction
- arranged with Jonathan, 7 pm

## 3) ScienceSource communication
Read through the ScienceSource documentation. Tomorrow making detailed action plan with Cesar.
